//Basic Command Line Calculator//

-Functioning calculator that can:

-- Do basic operations (+ - * /)

-- Do exponential operations (^n, nrt, ln, log)

-- Do trigonometric operations (sinx, cosx, tanx)

-- Remember the last result produced so that it can be reused by entering "ans" as the 1st value

-- Produce a list of operators

-- Truncate most operations to 2-3 decimal places for accuracy and prevention of round-off

----Exceptions include division, where 0.6666666 is a better answer for 2/3 than 0.7
